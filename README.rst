**Triton** is a dynamic binary analysis framework based on Pin. It provides components like a 
taint engine, a dynamic symbolic execution engine, a snapshot engine, translation of x64 
instruction into SMT2-LIB representation, a Z3 interface to solve constraints and Python bindings. 

Based on these components, Triton provides runtime behavior analysis, concolic execution 
for vulnerabilities research and/or can provide some reverse engineering assistance.
