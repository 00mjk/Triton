**Triton** is a dynamic binary analysis framework based on Pin. It provides components like a 
taint engine, a dynamic symbolic execution engine, a snapshot engine, translation of x64 
instruction into SMT2-LIB representation and a Z3 interface to solve constraints. 

Based on these components, Triton provides runtime behavior analysis and concolic execution 
for vulnerabilities research.
